# Temporal_Difference
Temporal Difference project of Udacity's Advance Machine Learning nanodegree

## Target :
Write my own implementations of many Temporal-Difference (TD) methods.

## Algorithm Class :
Temporal Differences

## Problem Type :
TBD

# Project Instructions
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the downloaded folder.

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/davidsprice/TemporalDifference
cd MonteCarlo
~~~~

2. Create and activate a new environment.

~~~~
conda create -n temporaldifference python=3.6 matplotlib numpy pandas keras-gpu
source activate temporaldifference
~~~~

3. Create an [IPython kernel](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the Temporal Difference environment.

~~~~
python -m ipykernel install --user --name temporaldifference --display-name "temporaldifference"
~~~~

4. Open the notebook.

~~~~
jupyter notebook Temporal_Difference.ipynb
~~~~

5. Before running code, change the kernel to match the quadcop environment by using the drop-down menu (Kernel > Change kernel > quadcop). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

6. You will likely need to install more pip packages to complete this project. Please curate the list of packages needed to run your project in the requirements.txt file in the repository.
